# Embuary Helper Script

## Welcome

This script has been developed to get all of my Embuary features to work.

But since it's feature rich it's also useful for any other skinner who wants to get special things done in his own skinning project. 

## Supported Kodi versions
* Krypton
* Leia

## Where to get it
* The most current versions are always available on [my private Kodi repo](https://repo.derfred.net/repositories/repository.fredsrepo/repository.fredsrepo-1.0.7.zip)
* The Leia version gets updated in intervals on the official Kodi repo
* The Krypton version never hits the Kodi repo and is only available on my personal one

## Important for TVOS and some Linux users
It's possible that you will get PIL errors in your logs. This error is not related to the script and is caused by incomplete or broken shipped Python PIL packages of your operation system. That means that things like the blurring feature won't work on your end. 

I've muted the error for Krypton but haven't applied this to the Leia branch, because you guys (Linux users) should be able to fix it manually by changing your installed Python module packages.
